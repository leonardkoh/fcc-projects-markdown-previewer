# fcc-projects-random-markdown-previewer
Tasks required:
<ul>
<li>User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".</li>
<li>User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".</li>
<li>User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.</li>
<li>User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).</li>
<li>User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.</li>
<li>User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.</li>
Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).
Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
</ul>
